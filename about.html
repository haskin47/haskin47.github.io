        Hello, dear reader! Welcome to my very own website, homme of any and all projects I complete in my time at RTC gong forward.
        <br> <br>
        I apologize for how sparse it is. But, I'll fix that soon enough as I learn more through out this semester.
        <br> <br>
        Anyhow, you came to read about me, right?
        <br> <br>
        My name is Nick Haskin. I've spent a decade and a half in various jobs relating to customer service and know how to communicate well with others. I am a proud member of the LDS faith (Mormon) and enjoy video games and tabletop roleplaying games.
        <br> <br>
        I am excited to continue my learning and courses at RTC, Web Dev especially.
